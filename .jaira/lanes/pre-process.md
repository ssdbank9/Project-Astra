# Prompt

Work out how this change should be made. Do not make it yet.

Read the goal, the context and the definition of done. Then decide the method:
what has to be understood first, what has to be designed, what has to be written,
and in what order. Where the shape of the change is not obvious, say what the
options are and which you would take.

Write the result as a `## Plan` checklist in the ticket body — one unticked item
per step, in the order they should happen:

```markdown
## Plan

- [ ] read how the existing exporter streams rows
- [ ] design the chunking boundary
- [ ] failing test for a 40MB export
- [ ] implement
```

Keep the steps at the size of a thing you can finish and mark done. "Implement
the feature" is not a step; it is the whole ticket restated.

When the plan rests on something you had to work out, put that reasoning in a
note (`jaira note <id> <text>`), so the next reader knows why the plan looks
like this rather than re-deriving it.

If the definition of done cannot be met as written — it is ambiguous, or it asks
for something the codebase makes impossible — say so and move the ticket to the
HITL lane with that question rather than planning around it.

The context is the only record of why this ticket exists. If it does not explain
that to someone who was not in the conversation — what is wrong today, what
triggered it, what is already known — do not guess and do not plan around it. Say
what is missing and move the ticket to the human lane.

If you rewrite or extend a context, write it as if the reader has mild ADHD and
knows none of what you know: what is wrong first, short concrete lines with one
point each, names and paths rather than adjectives, no jargon and no preamble.
Someone should be able to act after the first two lines.
